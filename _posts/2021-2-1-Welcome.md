Hello my name is Jack Giblin I am a third year biochemistry major at California Polytechnic San Luis Obispo. I am pursuing a career in medicine, specifically wanting to be a physicians assistant with hopes of a surgical subspecialty. I have a strong interest in organic synthesis and want to learn more about chemical pharmacology. I found my interest in chemistry in high school when taking AP chem. My entire life classes have been an evaluation of memory. I found that chemistry stresses the idea of critical thinking and allows for real time problem solving.
